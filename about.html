								  <h3>Our Statement of Purpose</h3>
								  <p>At White Hare Day Care we are passionate about children’s learning and education. We provide a secure, loving and caring environment for all children that come into our care.
								  	<br>At White Hare Day Care we are passionate about children’s learning and education. We provide a secure, loving and caring environment for all children that come into our care.
								  	<br>We work hard to build strong, respectful relationships with our children and their families from the first moment they step into our centre. We believe that we share the responsibility with parents and the wider community of working in collaboration to educate children to support them in their growth and development.
								  	<br>We encourage a positive self-image where everyone is treated with equal respect. Our staff at White Hare Day Care role model this to our children on a daily basis to help develop sensitivity towards others, multicultural awareness and a positive approach to learning. At White Hare Day Care we do not discriminate against children or their families for reasons such as race, religion, sex or ability.
								  	<br>We value children’s choice, allowing children to learn, grow and flourish at their own pace and ability. At White Hare Day Care we encourage independence and self-help skills in the aim of preparing children not just for school, but for life.
									“Never help a child with a task at which they feel they can succeed.” – Maria Montessori

								<div id="History" class="tabcontent">
								  <h3>History</h3>
								  <p>There is a long history of childcare provision associated with the Creggan area, with the White Hare playgroup existence from 1990 until 2005. This facility was a recognised leader in this field for many others that came behind. <br>With the closure of Creggan P.S. in 2010, Creggan community Association (CCA), following many appeals for childcare assistance, began a process of research and consultation which ndicated a strong need. However following fruitless attempts to acquire the necessary funding , CCA began intensive fundraising which culminated in the renovation of the old Creggan Community Centre.
								  <br>Today we are proud of our state of the art, purpose built, Children's Daycare Centre which we are even prouder to name White Hare Daycare - Creggan.
								  <br> We hope that this non profit business will grow in suppost of the community that it serves and will in itself set the template for other groups wishing to provide a similar service.
								  </p>
